    There is a cycle in a graph only if there is a back edge present in the graph.
    A back edge is an edge that is joining a node to itself (self-loop) or one of
    its ancestor in the tree produced by DFS.
    To find the back edge to any of its ancestor keep a visited array and if there
    is a back edge to any visited node then there is a loop and return true.

    *** Approach is simple : Just do a DFS and pass parent as one of parameter. Compare parent with
    next visited element, if they are not same then there is a back edge ***
